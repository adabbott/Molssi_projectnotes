Notes taken from Youtube video: Hyperopt: A python library for optimizing machine learning algorithms, Scipy 2013

Hyperopt is a tool for optimizing "hyperparameters", or parameters which are required as initial conditions for ML algorithms
    -finds better configurations
    -reproducible work
    -'free' testing without commitment

Hyperparameter configuration with hyperopt

Describing domain knowledge and search space (hyperopt.hp)

    -search space: what are you going to optimize over?
        -a random search, design a structured probability distribution that can sample from all configurations
            you would like to try

    -different search space RANGES:
        -continuous: uniform, normal
        -log scale: loguniform, lognormal (more likely to pick something close to a one sided bound)
        -quantized: quniform, qnormal (good for describing numbers of things, counts, eg number of hidden layers)
        -quantized log scale: qloguniform

    - search space categorical variable: variable has no order to it, 
        no similarity between values that happen to be close together
    - choice option: choosing between different schemes for a particular variable or set of variables

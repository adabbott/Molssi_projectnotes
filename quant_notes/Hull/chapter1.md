* **Derivative**: financial instrument whose value depends on the values of other more basic underlying variables. Often, the underlying
variable is the price of an asset.

* Derivatives may be traded on **exchanges**, in which they need to have standardized, pre-defined conditions 
    - often, on exchanged traded derivatives, financial institutions act as **market makers** for common instruments,
    meaning they trade both the bid and ask and try to profit from spreads, volatility, etc.

* Derivatives are also often traded OTC, between financial institutions and corporate clients


* **Forward contract** is arguably the simplest kind of derivative, which is
    an _agreement_ to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time, for a certain price.
    - one party of a forward contract is long, and agrees to buy, and the other is short, and agrees to sell (duh)
    - different from a spot contract, which is an agreement to buy/sell at the current market rate, "spot price"
    - The payoff for a long position is very simple, \\(S_T - K \\) where \\(S\\) is spot price and \\(K\\) is the delivery price
    - **Forward price** is the current market price for a particular forward contract, and this fluctuates over time
    - **Delivery price** is the agreed upon price of the asset specified by the contract, which is constant
    - The primary driving force for the difference between forward price and spot price is **interest rates**
    - Example, if one can borrow $300 at 5% annualized and buy gold for $300, and short a contract of 1 yr for $340, this price inefficiency allows $25 of risk-free earnings on the trade
    - known as an **arbitrage**, and will likely get priced out of the market in due time 

* Forward contracts are always OTC, and do not have an associated premium, unlike, say, options contracts

[2019-07-25 17:17:44,315] [WARNING] [optking.testB]: 
        	Some values did not agree.  However, numerical tests may fail for
        	torsions at 180 degrees and linear bond angles. This is OK
        	If discontinuities are interfering with a geometry optimization
        	try restarting your optimization at an updated geometry, and/or
        	remove angular coordinates that are fixed by symmetry.

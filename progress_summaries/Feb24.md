# Week of Feb 24

* Studied abstract algebra concepts relevant to constructing permutation invariant bases for expressing molecular geometries (Groups, rings, permutation groups, polynomial rings, fundamental invariants, permutational invariant polynomials)

* Learned how to use cclib, structure of the code, how it works.

* Added Psi4 gradient extraction support to cclib

* Read more papers on geometry input transformations for machine learning, looked into currently available software for doing this (see notes folder on this repo, PIPs.md)

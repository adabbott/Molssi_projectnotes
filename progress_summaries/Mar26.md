# Week of Mar 26

* Read new 2018 [review](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-physchem-050317-021139) by Bowman et al for permutationally invariant potential energy surfaces.

* Finished Magma code generator for finding the fundamental invariant polynomials of interatomic distances 

* Used magma code generator to generate Magma code for all possible molecular systems up through 10 atoms (took about 15 minutes)
    - TODO: download magma and run these input files, save the database of fundamental invariants to main repo
    - TODO: add magma code generator to main repo 

* Finished OutputFile class on main repo. Tests added. Can now extract energies and cartesian gradients with user-supplied regex expressions and cclib
